## üìã Project Overview

The Taxi Reservation System is a backend application that simulates the core logic of a ride-sharing service. It's designed to showcase clean code, robust architecture, and the practical application of design patterns. The primary goal is not to create a polished UI, but to build a strong foundation that could be extended into a full-fledged desktop or web application.

## üèõÔ∏è System Design & Architecture

This project is built with a component-based architecture, focusing on the separation of concerns.

#### Core Components:
* **Booking Service:** The central component that manages the entire lifecycle of a ride request, from matching a rider with a driver to finalizing the trip.
* **Location Service:** Responsible for tracking and updating the real-time locations of all drivers.
* **User Management:** Handles the profiles and data for both Riders and Drivers.
* **Database:** A conceptual layer for storing user data, ride history, and system state.

#### Object-Oriented Design:
The system is modeled using clear, object-oriented principles with classes such as:
* `User`, `Rider`, `Driver`: Representing the actors in the system.
* `Ride`: An object containing all details of a single trip (e.g., start/end location, fare, status).
* `Vehicle`: Represents the driver's car details.

#### Design Patterns Applied:
* **Singleton Pattern:** Used for the `BookingManager` to ensure a single, globally accessible instance controls all ride assignments.
* **Strategy Pattern:** Implemented for fare calculation, allowing for different pricing models (e.g., standard, peak-hour, long-distance) to be swapped easily.
* **Observer Pattern:** Used to notify different parts of the system about status changes in a `Ride` (e.g., notify billing when a ride is completed).

## ‚ú® Features

* **User & Driver Registration:** Onboard new riders and drivers to the system.
* **Ride Booking:** Allow riders to request a trip from a pickup point to a destination.
* **Driver Matching:** Automatically finds the nearest available driver for a ride request.
* **Fare Calculation:** Dynamically calculates the ride fare based on distance and pricing strategy.
